## Getting Started
First clone the repo.
`yarn` must be installed in order to run the project. There is a frontend application in react and an express proxy server. Rather than creating some kind of file upload

```
git clone https://github.com/ZeroAuto/image-uploadr.git
cd image-uploader/client
yarn install && yarn start
// open new terminal
cd image-uploader/server
yarn install && yarn start
```

#### To run this project you need a Cloudinary credentials. 
A .env file must be present in the `server` folder with the credentials below. I sent my credentials in an email to Sana. The app won't work without them.[/'']

```shell
// server/.env
CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
API_KEY=your_cloud_key
API_SECRET=your_cloud_secret
```

#### Future work
* Given more time I would definitely make this project look nicer. Using a frontend framework like bootstrap would make it easier.
* The images list, buttons and inputs could also be put into their own components to keep the App.js file from getting too big.
* If the images list got too big it would be a good idea to add pagination and set up the search text could trigger another get from the API, but would probably have to be debounced.
* Right now I'm using the filename to search images, but the API allows tags to be set that could also be searched for.
* Error handling should also be done on the serverside.
